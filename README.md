## Motivation
Bangladesh is an agricultural country. But most of our farmers don‚Äôt have much idea about modern cultivation, for this they are not being enough benefited from their cultivation. So if modern cultivation system can be introduced to them then it will bring betterment for both the farmers and the country. And I believe this application can help the farmers in modern cultivation.
And personally I belongs to a farmer family, so emotions directly kicked me into this right away. And I really feel the urge of this kind of application for better cultivation in my area.

## Objectives
In short we wanted to help the farmer in better cultivation. Well, we believe our application will work for this, but it‚Äôs totally theoretical, right? We don‚Äôt know if it will ever reach to the farmers. So right now we can‚Äôt say that our object is fulfilled. We believe, if it is given a chance then it will be helpful for the farmers. So now, we hope for the best, and that‚Äôs the best we can do, we hope.

And there was one more objectives for us, which is as much as important as the first one, well, maybe more. We wanted a good grade for the course.üòêÔ∏è And for this we are hoping for the best too.

## Target User
This application is mainly built for the farmers. Though most of the farmers in Bangladesh are illiterate, but with the digitalization of the country, android has reached to their homes via directly or indirectly through their family members. So a farmer will be using this application directly or through his family member who can operate android.

## Conclusions
This is the first project we have done which is not only for marks. Well, marks was the vital part obviously. We wanted it to be useful too. But deep down, we have a little bad feeling, maybe we lost the usefulness of the application a little in satisfying the marks. So right now I can‚Äôt say that I am totally satisfied though we fulfilled our requirements and completed the application almost as we wanted in the beginning.
Indeed it was a great working time. Instructor was helpful. Not always but we had a really good time working in this project. And we have completed it, so we are happy now. üòäÔ∏è
