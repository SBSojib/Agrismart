If your soil is correctly balanced or high in nitrogen, you should use a fertilizer that is slightly lower in nitrogen and higher in phosphorus, such as a 5-10-5 or a 5-10-10 mixed fertilizer. If you are slightly lacking in nitrogen, use a balanced fertilizer like 8-8-8 or 10-10-10. If you are unable to get a soil test done, unless you have had problems in the past with sickly tomato plants, you can assume that you have a balanced soil and use the higher phosphorus tomato plant fertilizer. When fertilizing tomato plants, be careful that you donâ€™t use too much nitrogen. This will result in a lush, green tomato plant with very few tomatoes. If you have experienced this problem in the past, you may even want to consider simply providing phosphorus to the plant instead of a complete fertilizer for tomatoes.
